 App Idea:
  -I want to create a messaging app that, depending on the recipient's preferred language, automatically translates messages in real-time. The application will recognize a message sent in English (or any other language) and immediately show the translated text in the recipient's preferred language, such as Mandarin, Spanish, or French, on their screen. Communication across language barriers would be smooth as a result. Real-time translation, language preference settings for each contact, multilingual support, and the option to view the original message if necessary are all important features. For international friendships, travel, or international business communication, this app may be extremely helpful.
 ## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
